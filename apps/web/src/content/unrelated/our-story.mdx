## How it began

Met via Twitter, we started working on OpenStatus in mid 2023. We did not have
any expectation and just wanted to build something cool with the latest tech. It
started all with:

- drizzle
- nextjs RSC
- turso
- tinybird

But with the time, it grew even more with:

- honojs
- bun
- flyio

and who knows what we are missing.

Eventually, thanks to the COSS movement, OpenStatus got some traction and is
part of the [OSS-friends](https://oss-friends.com) cool kids. We are now working
on OpenStatus and are looking for ways to make it sustainable.

## Our values

We are a small team of 2 people, we are not a company, we are not a startup. We
are not backed up by investors. We are not looking for investors. We want to
keep our freedom and build stuff we enjoy while providing value to the users.

Here is a little bit more about us.

### Who is Max?

I am a **self-taught developer**. During my Mathematics studies, I started to
learn coding and I fell in love with it. I am now a full-time developer and I am
working for Decathlon during the day, and for OpenStatus at night.

I own **open-source** and in general knowledge sharing my software development
career. Of course, lots of effort is needed to make it sustainable, but I am
happy to do it.

I spend days on building **well designed** UI/UX/DX. It's probably my strongest
and weakest point at the same time.

I live in Berlin, Germany and you can find me in the **boulder gym** when I am
not coding.
