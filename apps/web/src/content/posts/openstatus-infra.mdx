## Infrastructure Overview

OpenStatus is a synthetic monitoring platform designed with resilience, scalability, and efficiency in mind. Our infrastructure is a carefully orchestrated ecosystem of multiple applications and services, each playing a crucial role in delivering a comprehensive monitoring solution.

## Application Landscape

Our platform comprises several interconnected applications, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Frontend Ecosystem** The core of our user interaction is built on a robust, multi-faceted frontend architecture. We've strategically chosen technologies that provide optimal performance and developer experience:
    - A NextJS application that powers our marketing site, user dashboard, and status page
    - An Astro + Starlight-powered documentation platform, ensuring our users have comprehensive, easily navigable documentation
2. **Backend Infrastructure**
    -  API server: Our public API and our alerting engine
    - Probes/Checker:  a golang app deployed globally to monitor your service
    - Screenshot app: a service that takes screenshot of your website when we detect an downtime (Playwright)

## Managed Services

We also rely heavily on managed service to avoid handling it by ourselves.

### Scheduling and Job Management

Recognizing the critical nature of monitoring, we've implemented a robust scheduling strategy:

- **Cron Jobs**: Currently using Vercel Cron, with plans to migrate to Google Cron for an enhanced user experience
- **Job Queue**: Google Task Queues provide our distributed task management, with strategically segmented queues for different check frequencies

### Queue Architecture

We've implemented a granular queue system to ensure efficient task processing:

- Separate queues for frontend services
- Dedicated queues for API server and alerting engine
- Specialized queues for probes and screenshot services

### Hosting Strategy

Our multi-cloud approach ensures flexibility and optimal performance:

- Frontend: Hosted on Vercel for seamless deployment and edge networking
- Probes: Currently on Fly.io, with plans to transition to Koyeb
- Queue Management: Leveraging Google Cloud Platform (benefiting from Google credits)

### Monitoring and Alerting

We've built intelligent alerting mechanisms:

- Threshold-based monitoring on queue sizes
- Alerts triggered by data inactivity or queue backlog

### Data Infrastructure

- **Primary Database**: Turso, providing a scalable and efficient data storage solution
- **Analytics Database**: Tinybird, enabling complex analytical queries and insights

## Design Philosophy

Our infrastructure design is driven by several key principles:

- **Resilience**: Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance
- **Scalability**: Architectural choices that allow seamless growth
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Leveraging managed services and cloud credits
- **Performance**: Optimizing each component for maximum efficiency
