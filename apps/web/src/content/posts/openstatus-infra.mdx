## Infrastructure Overview

OpenStatus is a synthetic monitoring platform designed with resilience, scalability, and efficiency in mind. Our infrastructure is a carefully orchestrated ecosystem of multiple applications and services, each playing a crucial role.

## Application Landscape

Our platform comprises several interconnected applications, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Frontend Ecosystem** The core of our user interaction is built on a robust, multi-faceted frontend architecture. We've strategically chosen technologies that provide optimal performance and developer experience:
    - A NextJS application that powers our marketing site, user dashboard, and status page hosted on Vercel.
    - An Astro + Starlight-powered documentation platform, ensuring our users have comprehensive, easily navigable documentation hosted on Cloudfare Pages.
2. **Backend Infrastructure** All our backend services are hosted on Fly.io.
    - API server: Our public API and our alerting engine
    - Probes/Checker: a golang app deployed globally to monitor your service
    - Screenshot app: a service that takes screenshot of your website when we detect an downtime (Playwright)

## Managed Services

We also rely heavily on managed service to avoid handling it by ourselves. Here are some of the services we use

### Scheduling and Job Management

Recognizing the critical nature of monitoring, we've heavily rely on managed services for scheduling and job management:

- **Cron Jobs**: Currently using Vercel Cron, with plans to migrate to Google Cron for an enhanced user experience and taking advantage of Google Cloud Platform credits for cost savings.


### Queue Architecture

Every check are pushed to a queue and processed by our probes. The probes are responsible to check the status of your service.

- **Job Queue**: Google Task Queues provide our distributed task management, with strategically segmented queues for different check frequencies

We've implemented a granular queue system to ensure efficient task processing:

- Separate queues for frontend services
- Dedicated queues for API server and alerting engine
- Specialized queues for probes and screenshot services

### Hosting Strategy

Our multi-cloud approach ensures flexibility and optimal performance:

- Frontend: Hosted on Vercel for seamless deployment and edge networking
- Probes: Currently on Fly.io, with plans to add more providers for our global monitoring system.
- Queue Management: Leveraging Google Cloud Platform (benefiting from Google credits)


### Data Infrastructure

We also don't want to handle the data infrastructure by ourselves. We rely on managed services for that:

- **Primary Database**: Turso, providing a cost efficient data storage solution.
- **Analytics Database**: Tinybird, enabling complex analytical queries and insights.

## Design Philosophy

Our infrastructure design is driven by several key principles:

- **Resilience**: Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance
- **Scalability**: Architectural choices that allow seamless growth
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Leveraging managed services and cloud credits
- **Performance**: Optimizing each component for maximum efficiency.


# Conclusion

Building a resilient synthetic monitoring platform requires a thoughtful approach to infrastructure design. By carefully orchestrating our applications, services, and managed solutions, we've created a robust ecosystem that delivers on our promise of reliable monitoring and alerting.

The drawback of this approach is the complexity of providing an easy self hostable services.
