## Introduction

Why do we need to secure our APIs? Well, there are many reasons for that. The
most important one is that we want to protect your data from unauthorized
access.

We will learn how to secure our [Hono.js](https://hono.dev) API server with
[Unkey](https://unkey.dev).

Unkey is a service that allows you to create and manage API keys. It includes
useful features like:

- rate limiting: avoid getting DDoSed
- temporary keys: when working on free trials
- key limitation: limit the number of max. requests

**The best part**: We have no additional database migration or setup to do. Just
use the Unkey API and/or SDK to create and verify keys.

Hono is similar to express just hipper and runs on the edge.

### How does it work?

Whenever OpenStatus creates an API key, we will send a request to the Unkey API
using their [Typescript SDK](https://docs.unkey.dev/libraries/js/overview) with
the a specific `ownerId` which will be the `workspaceId` in our case. The user
will get an API key back which they can use to access their content via our API
route. Unkey will match the API key to the `ownerId` and we will be able to
validate that the request is the owner of the `workspaceId`.

As an example, here our Next.js `server action` (see
[GitHub](<https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/blob/main/apps/web/src/app/app/(dashboard)/%5BworkspaceSlug%5D/settings/_components/api-keys/actions.ts>))
to allow users to create and revoke their own API keys:

```ts
"use server";

import { Unkey } from "@unkey/api";

import { env } from "@/env";

const unkey = new Unkey({ token: env.UNKEY_TOKEN });

export async function create(ownerId: number) {
  const key = await unkey.keys.create({
    apiId: env.UNKEY_API_ID,
    ownerId: String(ownerId), // workspaceId
    prefix: "os", // os_1234567890
    // ratelimit
    // expires
    // remaining
  });
  return key;
}

export async function revoke(keyId: string) {
  const res = await unkey.keys.revoke({ keyId });
  return res;
}
```

To test the implementation, you can simply go to the
[Unkey Dashboard](http://unkey.dev/app) and create an API key manually instead
of using the SDK. The SDK is useful once you want your users to create API keys
programmatically.

## Getting started

Checkout [hono.dev](https://hono.dev) if you want to set up a new project or
follow along if you already have a Hono.js project.

We will pin point the most important parts of the setup. You can find the full
code source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/tree/main/apps/server).

### Create the base path

That's as simple as is looks. Create a `new Hono()` instance and define the
routes (`route`) and middlewares (`use`). For the sake of this example, we only
consider the `/api/v1/monitor` route.

```ts
import { middleware } from "./middleware";
import { monitorApi } from "./monitor";

export type Variables = { workspaceId: string }; // Context

const api = new Hono<{ Variables: Variables }>().basePath("/api/v1");

api.use("/*", middleware);
api.route("monitor", monitorApi);

export default app;
```

### Create the middleware

The middleware will automatically be applied to all routes that match the path
`/api/v1/*`. We will use the `x-openstatus-key` request header to append the API
key and verify it on our server.

We will use the Hono [Context](https://hono.dev/api/context) to store the
`workspaceId` we are getting from Unkey (which in fact is the `ownerId`) and
share it accross the application.

Here, we are verifying the API key via the
[`@unkey/api`](https://docs.unkey.dev/libraries/js/overview) package. It returns
either an `error` or the `result.valid` whether or not to grant access.

```ts
import { verifyKey } from "@unkey/api";
import type { Context, Next } from "hono";

import type { Variables } from "./index";

export async function middleware(
  c: Context<{ Variables: Variables }, "/api/v1/*">,
  next: Next,
) {
  const key = c.req.header("x-openstatus-key");

  if (!key) return c.text("Unauthorized", 401);

  const { error, result } = await verifyKey(key);

  if (error) return c.text("Bad Request", 400);
  if (!result.valid) return c.text("Unauthorized", 401);

  c.set("workspaceId", `${result.ownerId}`);

  await next();
}
```

### Create the route

Every route, here `monitorApi`, will have access to the `workspaceId` via the
Context and therefore can query the database for the workspace.

```ts
import type { Variables } from "./index";

export const monitorApi = new Hono<{ Variables: Variables }>();

monitorApi.get("/:id", async (c) => {
  const workspaceId = c.get("workspaceId");
  const { id } = c.req.valid("param");

  // ...fetch data from your database [e.g. via Drizzle ORM]
  const monitor = await db
    .select()
    .from(monitor)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(monitor.id, Number(id)),
        eq(monitor.workspaceId, Number(workspaceId)),
      ),
    )
    .get();

  return c.json(monitor);
});
```

[here](https://hono.dev/api/routing#path-parameter).

### Test it locally

Once your project is running, you can test your implementation with the
following curl command:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/monitor/1' \
--header 'x-openstatus-key: os_1234567890'
```

We are running our Hono.js server on [fly.io](https://fly.io) via `bun start`.

We have added the `@hono/zod-openapi` plugin so that we can generate an OpenAPI
spec out of the box. Read about the supported endpoints in our
[docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/rest-api/openapi).

## Conclusion

Unkey increases our velocity and helps us focus on what's relevant to the user,
not the infrastructure behind. We also get key verification insights out of the
box and can target specific customers based on their usage.
