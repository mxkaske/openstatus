We began the new year with two goals: to increase profitability and attract more
paid users. One way to accomplish this was to overhaul our pricing.

However, this was a challenging task due to the complexity of pricing.

We have introduced two new plans and renamed our current plan as follows:

- Starter: 29e (previously known as the Pro plan)
- Growth: 79e
- Pro: 149e

We went through multiple iterations before selecting them.

We will discuss the challenges we faced while setting up our new pricing.

## Per Seat pricing sucks üóëÔ∏è

When I initially shared the draft of our new pricing, we had a per seat
limitation. It was shamelessly copied from our competitor, who all use per seat
pricing.

We believed it was the simplest way for our users to upgrade to a higher tier.
However, the first reaction from
[@tibotiber](https://www.twitter.com/@tibotiber),
[@notrab](https://www.twitter.com/notrab), and
[@chronark\_](https://www.twitter.com/@chronark_) was to eliminate the per seat
pricing.

I agreed with them, as per seat pricing doesn't add any value in our case. If I
were one of our users, I would probably just create a team account with a
catch-all email and share the credentials with the team (Any resemblance to
actual events is purely coincidental.)

We dropped the per seat pricing.

It will be one of our advantages compared to our competitors. We want more users
to use our product.

## Don‚Äôt be cheap üí∏

By the end of December, I have been asked for a ‚Ç¨9 plan. Initially, when we
revised our pricing plan, we added this as our first option.

We believed that offering a plan at such a low price would attract more
customers, as ‚Ç¨9 is affordable for most companies and it would show their
support for us.

We are a bootstrapped business, and we can't compete on cheaper pricing, but we
can compete with a better product, though.

Also, if we have a cheaper plan, our customers will be biased towards using our
product. We won't feel it's worth the same thing as our competitor, even if our
product offers a better alternative to them.

Avoiding underpricing was the most challenging for us.

## How we priced our plans üìà

We have wanted to only to price our product based on the value it provides to
our users.

Thus we are only charging for:

- The number of monitors
- The number of alerts

## Why did we keep the free plan? ü§î

Some bootstrappers ([here](https://marclou.beehiiv.com/p/ditch-your-free-plan))
will tell you to remove the free plan. It's a waste of time. We have limited the
number of monitors to be enough for a small side project. But for us, it's a way
to get more users to use our product. And if more users are using our hosted
status page we will have more SEO backlink and it's a win for us.

Let‚Äôs see in couple of month if our new pricing works for us. If you want to
