We began the new year with two goals: to increase profitability and attract more
paid users. One way to accomplish this was to overhaul our pricing.

However, this was a challenging task due to the complexity of pricing.

We have introduced two new plans and renamed our current plan as follows:

- Starter: 29e (previously known as the Pro plan)
- Growth: 79e
- Pro: 149e

We went through multiple iterations before selecting them.

In this article, we will discuss the challenges we faced while setting up our
new pricing.

## Per Seat pricing sucks üóëÔ∏è

When I initially shared the draft of our new pricing, we had a per seat
limitation. It was shamelessly copied from our competitor, who all use per seat
pricing.

We believed it was the simplest way for our users to upgrade to a higher tier.
However, the first reaction from
[@tibotiber](https://www.twitter.com/@tibotiber),
[@notrab](https://www.twitter.com/notrab), and
[@chronark\_](https://www.twitter.com/@chronark_) was to eliminate the per seat
pricing.

I agreed with them, as per seat pricing doesn't add any value in our case. If I
were one of our users, I would probably just create a team account with a
catch-all email and share the credentials with the team (Any resemblance to
actual events is purely coincidental.)

We dropped the per seat pricing.

It will be one of our competitive advantages compared to our competitors. We
want more users to use our product.

## Don‚Äôt be cheap üí∏

By the end of December, @tibotiber sent me a message expressing their interest
in a ‚Ç¨9 plan. Initially, when we revised our pricing plan, we added this as our
first option.

We believed that offering a plan at such a low price would attract more
customers, as ‚Ç¨9 is affordable for most companies and it would show their
support for us.

We are a bootstrapped business, and we can't compete on cheaper pricing, but we
can compete with a better product, though.

Also, if we have a cheaper plan, our customers will be biased towards using our
product. We won't feel it's worth the same thing as our competitor, even if our
product offers a better alternative to them.

Avoiding underpricing was the most challenging for us.

Let‚Äôs see in couple of month if our new pricing works for us. At the mean time
