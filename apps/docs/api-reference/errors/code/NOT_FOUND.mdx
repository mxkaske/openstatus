## Problem

The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

## Solution

Make sure you're sending the correct request to the correct endpoint. If you're sure you're sending the correct request, check the request by debugging or logging it and making sure it's correct.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://openstatus.dev/discord).
