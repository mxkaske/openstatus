title: CONFLIC
openapi-schema: ErrConflict

## Problem

The request could not be completed due to a conflict most likely due to unique constraints like subdomain slugs.

## Solution

Make sure you're sending the correct request to the correct endpoint. If you're sure you're sending the correct request, check the request by debugging or logging it and making sure it's correct.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://openstatus.dev/discord).
