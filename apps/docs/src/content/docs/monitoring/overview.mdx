import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

With synthetic monitoring, you can simulated requests to monitor the availability and performance of
your website, API, or server from various locations around the world.

We will make a request to your website or API on a regular schedule and record the
responses.

We will alert you if your website or API is down, is timing out or does not return the expected response.

You can create monitors in our dashboard, with the [API](https://api.openstatus.dev/v1#tag/monitor/POST/monitor) or with our [Terraform provider](/tools/terraform).


### What is a monitor?

A monitor is a job that runs periodically or on-demand and checks the status of a service. It
can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.

We will make a request to your endpoint and record the results.
