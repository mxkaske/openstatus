First you need to create a monitor to start monitoring your services.

## What is a monitor?

A monitor is a job that runs periodically or on-demand and checks the status of a service. A monitor will do some synthetic checks to ensure that your service is working as expected.


## Create your first monitor

Go to the **Monitors** page and click on the **Create Monitor** button.

## Configure your monitor

Your endpoint check requires:

- a **name** to identify your monitor
- the **URL** to checked

We will store the **response time**, the **status code**, the **headers**
returned, and the **timing metrics** of your endpoint.

    src={monitorDetail}
    alt="Charts with status code and response time"
  />


### HTTP Request

Customize the request sent to your endpoint.

Choose between one of the request **HTTP Method**: `GET` (default), `POST` or
`HEAD`.

Add custom key-value **HTTP Headers** to your request.

> OpenStatus automatically set the `"User-Agent": "OpenStatus/1.0"` header to
> your request. This header is used to identify the request as a ping request
> and can be exluded from your analytics.



If you select the `POST` method, you can add a custom **HTTP Body** to your
request.




## Customization

You can customize your monitor with the following options:

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
        title="Assertions"
        href="/monitoring/customization/assertions"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Frequency"
        href="/monitoring/customization/frequency"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Regions"
        href="/monitoring/customization/regions"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Timing"
        href="/monitoring/customization/timing"
    />
</CardGrid>



## Known Limitations

<Aside>If you are monitoring an endpoint you don't own (e.g google.com), your request might be blocked by the remote server.</Aside>
