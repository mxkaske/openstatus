## How to get started with OpenStatus?

You can either use the cloud version of OpenStatus or self-host it.


### Cloud version

You can [sign up](https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login?ref=docs) for a free account and begin monitoring your services in seconds.

### Self Hosted version

All our code is open-source and you can host it on your own infrastructure.

<Aside>
    It is not easy to self-host OpenStatus on your own at the moment. We will be working on community version to make it easier in the future.

### Commmunity version

We are working on a multiple community version of OpenStatus that will be easier to self-host.

#### Vercel Edge Checker

You can use our [Vercel Edge Checker](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping) version of OpenStatus. It is a simple version of OpenStatus that can be deployed to Vercel with one click.


<Aside>
More version will be available in the future. ðŸš§
