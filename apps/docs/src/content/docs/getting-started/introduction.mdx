## How to get started with OpenStatus?

You can either use the cloud version of OpenStatus or self-host it.


### Cloud version

You can (sign up)[https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login?ref=docs] for a free account and start monitoring your services in seconds.

### Hosted version

All our code is open-source and you can host it on your own infrastructure.

We are working on a lightweight version of OpenStatus that you can self-host easily.

<Aside>
    It is not easy to self-host OpenStatus on your own at the moment. We will be working on making it easier in the future.
