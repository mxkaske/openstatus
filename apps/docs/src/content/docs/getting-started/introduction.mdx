## What is OpenStatus 🧑‍🏫

[OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) is an open-source synthetic monitoring platform. It allows you to monitor your services and get notified when they are down.


## How to get started 🚀

You can either use the hosted version of OpenStatus or self-host it.

<Aside>
    It is not easy to self-host OpenStatus on your own at the moment. We will be working on making it easier in the future.
