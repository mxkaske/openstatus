## How to get started with OpenStatus?

You can either use the cloud version of OpenStatus or self-host it.


### Cloud version

You can [sign up](https://www.openstatus.dev/app/login?ref=docs) for a free account and begin monitoring your services in seconds.

### Self Hosted version

All our code is open-source and you can host it on your own infrastructure.

<Aside>
    It is not easy to self-host OpenStatus on your own at the moment. We will be working on making it easier in the future.

###  Lightweight Self hosted

If you want to self-host OpenStatus, you can use our lightweight version of OpenStatus called [Vercel Edge Checker](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping).
